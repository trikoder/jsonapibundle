     * satisfied as it extends it.
     *
     * Reasoning for that is we wanna avoid usage of neomerx stuff outside of bundle layer so that there are not
     * additional direct dependencies for bundle and in the future, we can move from neomerx to some other package
     * without need to change our projects and have all changes only in bundle.
