# Configuration

It can be done via controller annotations and global defaults.

## Glossary
For needs of this document, term Field means any model attribute or relation.

## Configuration directives

### model class
Model class that this controller is responsible of. Defaults to `\stdClass`.

### create

- `\Trikoder\JsonApiBundle\Model\ModelFactoryResolverInterface`

Defaults to built in service `trikoder.jsonapi.simple_model_factory` that by default is `\Trikoder\JsonApiBundle\Model\Factory\SimpleModelFactory`

#### allowed fields

## Global configuration
Global configuration is done by defining `trikoder_json_api` section in application configuration.
Global defaults configuration example can be found in [example.yml](examples/example.yml).

## Controller annotations
Each controller can define it's own configuration by class annotation.

Example of annotation configuration can be found in [exampleAnnotation.php](examples/exampleAnnotation.php).


## Traits
The crud actions can be enabled by using traits that come with the bundle. 
Each action of CRUD has corresponding trait (or several of them for simple/specific behaviours).

### Retrieve

#### ShowActionTrait

#### IndexActionTrait

#### PaginatedActionTrait
 Incomplete implementation - to be implemented

### Create

#### CreateActionTrait

### Update

#### UpdateActionTrait

### Delete

#### DeleteActionTrait
