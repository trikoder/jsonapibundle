# Schema class map

Schema class map is object that providers map of models and their respective schemas for the api engine.
It must implement `\Trikoder\JsonApiBundle\Contracts\SchemaClassMapProviderInterface`.

The schema class map can be provided and used in several ways.

## Defining
### 1. Method in controller
Api engine calls controller method `getSchemaClassMapProvider` to get map provider. 
In your code, you can override this method to return your implementation of SchemaClassMapProviderInterface.
By default, the `trikoder.jsonapi.schema_class_map_provider` service is fetched.

This method can be used to append or change schema map for controller. Override the method, call parent method and update the result before returning.

### 2. Change class of trikoder.jsonapi.schema_class_map_provider service
In your configuration you can change value of `trikoder.jsonapi.schema_class_map_provider.class` parameter to be any class that you implement SchemaClassMapProviderInterface.

### 3. Redefine trikoder.jsonapi.schema_class_map_provider
In your services configuration you can redefine `trikoder.jsonapi.schema_class_map_provider` service with your required class.

## Usage
`SchemaClassMapProviderInterface` implements two methods. One of them is add method that enables to register schemas for models.

Add method receives two parameters:
- $class - FQN of class that provided schema should be used for
- $schema - FQN or class of closure that returns instance of the schema that should be used for the model. 
Closure must accept two arguments `SchemaFactoryInterface $factory, ContainerInterface $serviceContainer` (!IMORTANT - second argument for Closure - service container is deprecated and will be removed in the future in favour of autowiring).
